        "The library supports multiple deep learning frameworks, primarily PyTorch and TensorFlow, and includes APIs that make it easy to switch between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Model Hub\n",
        "The Hugging Face Model Hub is a repository and sharing platform for machine learning models. It hosts thousands of pre-trained models contributed by both Hugging Face and the community.\n",
        "Users can find, share, and download models for various tasks (not limited to NLP, but also including computer vision, audio, and more).\n",
        "The hub allows seamless model access via model IDs that can be loaded directly into the transformers library, enabling rapid experimentation and deployment.\n",
